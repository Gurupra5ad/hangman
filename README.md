30 DAY Challenge - DAY 8

As a part of day 8 challenge in my 30 days = 30 projects challenge, I am going to build a hangman game in commandline. Here, The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes. If the player guess a letter which exists in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions.  The player has 10 turns to guess the word. You can easily customize the game by changing the variables.
